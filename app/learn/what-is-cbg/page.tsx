          CBG is a naturally occurring hemp cannabinoid. Many hemp varieties
          contain smaller amounts of CBG than CBD, which is why CBG-rich product
          labels and lab reports matter.
        </InfoCard>
        <InfoCard icon={BookOpen} title="How CBG differs from CBD">
          CBG and CBD are different cannabinoids. Neither name alone tells the
          full product story. The best source is the current label and COA for
          the exact batch being sold.
        </InfoCard>
        <InfoCard icon={ShieldCheck} title="Whether CBG is intoxicating">
          CBG is not the cannabinoid typically associated with intoxication. The
          Funni Farm products should be reviewed as non-intoxicating hemp goods
          for adults, with COAs used to verify batch details.
